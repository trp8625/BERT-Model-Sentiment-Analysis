# Investigating the Role of Sentiment in Motivational Strategies Using Transformer-Based Models: Associations With Psychiatric Traitsâ€‹

# This project examines whether sentiment expressed in self-reported motivational strategies is linked to psychiatric traits such as anxiety, rumination, pleasure, and self-esteem. Using SiEBERT, a BERT-based sentiment analysis model, the emotional tone of motivational responses was assessed and its relationship with these psychiatric measures.

# Presented at the **13th Annual BMEII Symposium (AI/ML Program)** at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
